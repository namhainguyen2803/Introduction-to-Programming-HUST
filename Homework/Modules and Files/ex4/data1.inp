The Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, is a technology demonstration to test powered, 
controlled   flight on another world for the first time. 
It hitched a ride to Mars   on the  Perseverance rover. 
   Once the rover reached a   suitable "airfield" location, 
it released Ingenuity to the surface   so it could perform a series 
  of test flights over a  30-Martian-day experimental window.
